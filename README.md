# Natural Language Interface to Database

A demostration of how developers can use SIML or Oscova to create a natural language interface to database.

**Note:** Build both the projects in `Debug` mode.

## Oscova

The Oscova project contains all required Intents and design patterns to create custom Oscova Dialogs.

The project also demonstrates:

* Creating custom Entity Recognizers by reading through Database entries.
* Add Dialogs to the Bot
* Work with contextual intents
* Share data between different Intents.

## SIML

All example patterns are highlighted within the Examples tab. The database used in this demo application is reset to its initial value upon restart.

The knowledge-base of this project also implements an intelligent suggestion system to address queries that are very similar to existing patterns. Thereby teaching the user the right format of presenting questions to the Database.
