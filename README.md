# Natural Language Interface to Database using SIML

A demostration of how developers can use SIML to create a natural language interface to databases. All example patterns are highlighted within the Examples tab. The database used in this demo application is reset to its initial value upon restart.

## Suggestion System

The knowledge-base of this project also implements an intelligent suggestion system to address queries that are very similar to existing patterns. Thereby teaching the user the right format of presenting questions to the Database.

## Note

Please build the project in `Debug` mode so that the knowledge-base project file can be properly located on startup.
